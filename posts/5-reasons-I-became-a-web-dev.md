5 reasons I became a web dev
============================



* * *

> Sean Swanson (he/him/they) is a web developer and Scrum Master of 4+ years

There is an idea among young people that there are certain qualities or abilities that allow individuals to succeed in tech. I’m not being sensational when I say that **anyone** (with an internet connection) **can do this**.

This article walks through:

*   [How it started](#how)
*   [1\. Flexibility](#flex)
*   [2\. Culture](#culture)
*   [3\. Creativity](#creative)
*   [4\. Time off](#PTO)
*   [5\. Make a difference and learn](#learn)

How it started
--------------

The path that my career took to web development was far from traditional. I studied philosophy at the University of Washington for a bachelor’s degree. During school, I was focused on the act of learning and being immersed in my studies and didn’t think too much about a long-term career.

Towards the end of my undergraduate career, I was presented with the opportunity to pursue a promising path into fashion modeling. During the last few weeks of my senior year, I flew to New York for **Fashion Week**. I was able to finish my degree online and began traveling a few months at a time for modeling. In the interim, I would wait tables at the local restaurant I had been working at for years.

I found the lack of stability challenging and quickly realized that the dream of modeling that I had been exploring since I was 18 was not a viable career for me. So, I began to look at other career trajectories. A found out about a friend of a friend who went the self-taught developer route and landed a **six-figure job almost immediately** after they graduated from a bootcamp.

Once I seriously considered coding I began kicking myself for not seeing the similarities to what I learned in undergrad. Reading about what it takes to be successful in tech, I noticed that philosophy has undeniable connections to coding and computer science. One of the first things I learned in philosophy was **critical thinking**. Important to business, higher education, and many other disciplines, critical thinking is also incredibly important in coding. My studies expanded to **arguments** and **logic** as well as advanced problem-solving processes; all of which are easily transferable to computer science.

My bootcamp was a comprehensive course that taught us to build a web app from early project design all the way through to development and maintenance. This granted me exposure to certain areas of coding that I wanted to try but immediately wasn’t sold on.

> As a developer or as an artist, you most likely do things where you realize, ‘Oh, this type of thing is not as fun to me.’ Some problems are more fun than others to solve, and you end up gravitating toward things that may come more naturally to you or that you have a specific interest in. And in my case, it was **front-end development**.

### 1\. Flexibility [#](#1.-Flexibility-)

Flexibility is the reason I sought out a career in tech to begin with. A constant whirlwind of modeling and service industry jobs made it hard to save money or have a structure that was fully my own. I wanted a career that gave me flexibility in how I live and work.

> If I knew that I would have all this time at home, I would have loved to have taken this job right out of high school.

Even pre-Covid, many software engineers determined the schedules that worked best for them. Now, working from home is streamlined and more acceptable. More employees are finding themselves back in offices, but often there is a choice to return. This level of freedom may be taken for granted by some in engineering roles, but coming from the service industry to a role with this degree of flexibility is a great blessing.  

### 2\. Culture [#](#2.-Culture-)

I have found that during my time as a dev, people in this field are almost always willing to lend a helping hand. Granted, your mileage may vary, but for the most part, I believe that web development communities on the internet have become a net positive to the tech space.

One of the best parts of being a front-end developer is the ample opportunity to experience emerging technologies along with other curious folk. At the same time, you can still find engineers chugging away with code and languages that could be 30 years old in these internet communities. Everyone can find their niche and find an audience for their advice.

> There is a unique “choose your own adventure” newness in tech that sets it apart from other fields.

When I started at [DreamBox](https://www.dreambox.com/), I wasn’t initially assigned a front-end developer role. I grew into the position from a junior, non-developer role. But because of the rate of growth in the industry, I was able to start coding and even become a Scrum Master for my team in short order.

Much like my path in the bootcamp, you are able to try out as many specializations as you need to figure out what you want to do and what you don’t care for.

### 3\. Creativity [#](#3.-Creativity-)

Coders are often painted as this stereotype of anti-creative or obligate left-brained. Obviously, this isn’t true, but I find that kids who are interested in the arts and humanities can completely breeze right past the idea of software development because they think it’s not for them. This is falling by the wayside to a certain extent, but there is still a case to be made for computer science to be recognized as a creative profession.

As someone engaged with the arts and humanities, front-end development affords me the time and capital to pursue creative hobbies. Realizing that it’s never too late to switch careers helped me realize that I could pick up new hobbies as well.

A few years ago, I started **breaking** (popularly known as ‘breakdancing’, but that’s not the proper name) as a new way to get exercise, connect with others, and be creative. Forms of creative expression and realization are important to ensure stability and groundedness when pursuing career fulfillment. Especially when it comes to establishing a work-life balance.

  

### 4\. Time off [#](#4.-Time-off-)

One of the most important things I have learned over the course of my career path is to take the time to invest in yourself. In my case, this meant knowing when to switch it up. You have to be willing to go with the flow. There are many different forms and permutations your career can take, and it’s healthy to not box yourself in.

Time off can help you realize your professional goals as well as be an outlet for creativity and exploration. It varies by organization, but many software engineers and web developers are afforded generous time off opportunities.

According to the [Stackoverflow 2022 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/), 88% of professional programmers code as a hobby.

This reveals multiple aspects of the industry.

There is a trend among software developers to **constantly be productive**. Unsurprisingly, this can create work-life balance stressors. **Competition in the industry** can lead to long hours chasing the need to keep up with the most recent trends, but this culture of hobby coding can also birth truly creative, novel projects that inspire those around us. To ensure a healthy relationship between you and your work, time off is essential.

> **Burnout is real**, and something to recognize. If something’s not working for you, be flexible and patient with yourself and know that you could spend the time to pivot.

  

### 5\. Make a difference and learn [#](#5.-Make-a-difference-and-learn-)

> I personally think that more fulfilling work comes from leading a purpose or a mission, whether it’s personal or someone else’s mission that you feel really strongly aligned with.

There is so much opportunity in the tech field that it is not only possible but likely that you can find an organization that you really mesh with. I work as a front-end developer for **[Dreambox](https://www.dreambox.com/).** Dreambox creates personalized and adaptive math and reading software for kids. Our mission is to radically transform the way the world learns. For me, it is important to have this sense of service and change in my work. I am fortunate enough that web development allowed me to choose where and how I spend my time.

I write more in-depth about this idea of moral fulfillment in your work in the first piece I wrote with Educative: [Learn to code for social good: my philosophy as an artist & dev](https://www.educative.io/blog/my-coding-philosophy-artist).

But my passion for learning really helped get me to where I am today. Deriving joy from learning helped to get the ball rolling on my career transition. Consequently, it helped me find my current role at Dreambox. It has always been important to me to align with the values of my workplace, and distributing valuable learning resources to kids around the world is an inspiring mission statement and one I can be proud of.

Exercising a software engineering position as a vantage point to pass along knowledge is something I feel **morally obligated** to do. I aim to embody this in my professional life– both in my guest pieces here on the Educative blog and as a leader in my workplace. I am thankful that the organization I work for shares these values in the form of the dissemination of knowledge through education.

#### How Dreambox works:

*   DreamBox analyzes data in its _Intelligent Adaptive Engine_ to gauge each child’s math development level and provide targeted lessons suitable for all children.
    
*   Performance data is collected and translated into an administrator dashboard in real-time.
    
*   Educators can then access this dashboard to track progress.
    

We use our vantage point to introduce the right lessons at the right time so that learning is supplemented with technology.

On a smaller scale, being a Scrum Master means that I can serve my team members as well. I’m helping a team of developers adapt to **SAFe**, or Scaled Agile Framework. While a lot of this role is based in servant leadership it also includes leaning into technical and strategic planning, with dashes of relationship management.

> I think \[relationship management\] is a soft skill that is lacking in the tech world, at least as far as engineering. I think that the ability to bridge that divide is going to be very important for people getting in tech. By bringing that mentality to the workplace you are able to unify your teams. Bantering with your engineers but also hanging with your product owner.

So much new blood is entering the tech industry that the landscape is always changing. Fresh perspectives and people with diverse backgrounds help to break down conventional tech silos and create workspaces that are truly collaborative.
